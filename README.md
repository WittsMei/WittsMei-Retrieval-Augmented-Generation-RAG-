### Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) 
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the quality of LLM output by grounding it with sources of knowledge not available in the trained model.

- With RAG, you modify the prompt to provide extra data, including **proprietary data**, to the model. No fine tuning of the model is required. For example, Gemini has been trained against public data, so your organization's knowledge bases and other private data is not a part of the Gemini model.

- RAG provides the model with access to information retrieved from trusted knowledge bases or documents, which improves accuracy of responses. This information can include proprietary data that is not in the model, as well as sensitive user-specific data that should never be put into a training model.
